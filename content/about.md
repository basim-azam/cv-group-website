## Our Mission

The Computer Vision Group at the University of Melbourne is dedicated to advancing the field of computer vision and machine learning through innovative research that addresses fundamental scientific questions and real-world challenges. We aim to develop intelligent visual systems that are robust, interpretable, and beneficial to society.

## Research Philosophy

Our research is guided by several core principles:

**Rigor and Innovation**: We pursue research that combines theoretical depth with practical impact, pushing the boundaries of what's possible while maintaining scientific rigor.

**Responsibility**: We believe in developing AI systems that are not only powerful but also trustworthy, interpretable, and aligned with human values. Our work on adversarial robustness and explainable AI reflects this commitment.

**Collaboration**: We actively collaborate with researchers across disciplines and institutions worldwide, fostering an environment of open scientific exchange.

**Mentorship**: We are committed to training the next generation of researchers, providing comprehensive support and guidance to our students.

## Key Research Themes

Our group focuses on several interconnected research areas:

### Adversarial Machine Learning
Understanding and defending against attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in deep learning systems. We develop both attack methodologies for testing robustness and defense mechanisms for building more resilient AI.

### Explainable AI
Making deep learning models interpretable and their decisions understandable to humans. This is crucial for deploying AI in high-stakes domains like healthcare and autonomous systems.

### 3D Point Cloud Analysis
Processing and understanding 3D visual data from sensors like LiDAR for applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and scene understanding.

### Medical Image Analysis
Applying computer vision to medical imaging for improved diagnostics, leveraging deep learning while ensuring interpretability for clinical adoption.

### Remote Sensing
Analyzing satellite and aerial imagery for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and agricultural applications using advanced deep learning techniques.

### Deep Learning for Vision
Fundamental advances in visual representation learning, including novel architectures, training methods, and multi-modal learning.

## Our Group

Led by Dr. Naveed Akhtar, an ARC DECRA Fellow and Senior Lecturer at the School of Computing and Information Systems, our group brings together talented researchers from diverse backgrounds united by a passion for advancing computer vision.
