Our paper "Improved MLP Point Cloud Processing with High-Dimensional Positional Encoding" has been accepted at AAAI 2024.

## About the Paper

This work, by Yanmei Zou, Hongshan Yu, Zhengeng Yang, Zechuan Li, and Naveed Akhtar, presents a novel approach to improving MLP-based point cloud processing through high-dimensional positional encoding.

The method achieves competitive performance with transformer-based approaches while maintaining the efficiency benefits of MLP architectures.

The paper will be presented at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Vancouver, Canada.
