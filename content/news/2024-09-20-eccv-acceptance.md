Our work on "Regulating Model Reliance on Non-robust Features by Smoothing Input Marginal Density" has been accepted at ECCV 2024.

## About the Paper

This paper, authored by Peiyu Yang, Naveed Akhtar, Mubarak Shah, and Ajmal Mian, presents a novel approach to improving the robustness of deep learning models by reducing their reliance on non-robust features.

The key insight is that by smoothing the input marginal density, we can encourage models to learn more robust representations that generalize better to adversarial and out-of-distribution inputs.

The paper will be presented at the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2024 in Milan, Italy.
