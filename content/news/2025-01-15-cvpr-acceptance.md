We are excited to announce that three papers from our group have been accepted at CVPR 2025, the premier conference in computer vision.

## Accepted Papers

### Mono3DVLT: Monocular-Video-Based 3D Visual Language Tracking
*Hongkai Wei, Yang Yang, Shijie Sun, Mingtao Feng, Xiangyu Song, Qi Lei, Hongli Hu, Rong Wang, Huansheng Song, Naveed Akhtar, Ajmal Mian*

This work presents a novel approach to 3D visual language tracking from monocular video, enabling natural language-guided object tracking in 3D space.

### Motion-Grounded Video Reasoning: Understanding and Perceiving Motion at Pixel Level
*Andong Deng, Tongjia Chen, Shoubin Yu, Taojiannan Yang, Lincoln Spencer, Yapeng Tian, Ajmal Mian, Mohit Bansal, Chen Chen*

This paper introduces a new benchmark and method for understanding fine-grained motion in videos at the pixel level.
