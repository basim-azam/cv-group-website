Our research in adversarial machine learning addresses one of the most critical challenges in deploying AI systems: ensuring they remain robust and reliable when faced with adversarial inputs or attacks.

## Research Focus

We investigate both the vulnerabilities of deep learning systems and methods to defend against exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Our work spans:

- **Attack generation and analysis**: Understanding how adversarial examples are created and what makes them effective
- **Certified defenses**: Developing provable guarantees for model robustness
- **Backdoor attacks**: Investigating training-time attacks and detection methods
- **Robustness in multimodal models**: Extending adversarial robustness to vision-language and generative models

## Impact

Our research helps ensure that AI systems can be safely deployed in security-critical applications, from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis systems.
