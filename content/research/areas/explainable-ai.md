As AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, understanding their decision-making process becomes essential. Our explainable AI research develops methods to interpret deep learning models and provide human-understandable explanations.

## Research Focus

- **Attention visualization**: Understanding what parts of an input influence model predictions
- **Concept-based explanations**: Explaining model behavior in terms of human-understandable concepts
- **Feature attribution**: Identifying which input features contribute to specific predictions
- **Interpretable architectures**: Designing neural networks with built-in interpretability

## Impact

Our work supports the responsible deployment of AI by enabling users to understand, verify, and trust AI-powered decisions.
