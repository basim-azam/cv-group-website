We develop deep learning methods for medical image analysis, with the goal of assisting clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning while ensuring interpretability and reliability.

## Research Focus

- **Medical image segmentation**: Precise delineation of anatomical structures and pathologies
- **Disease detection**: Automated detection and classification of diseases from imaging data
- **Multi-modal imaging**: Integrating information from multiple imaging modalities
- **Interpretable medical AI**: Ensuring clinicians can understand and verify AI recommendations

## Clinical Impact

Our research aims to improve patient outcomes by providing clinicians with AI-powered tools that augment their expertise while maintaining transparency in decision-making.
