Point cloud data from LiDAR sensors and depth cameras provides rich 3D information about the environment. Our research develops advanced deep learning methods for processing this unstructured 3D data.

## Research Focus

- **Semantic segmentation**: Assigning semantic labels to each point in a scene
- **3D object detection**: Localizing and classifying objects in 3D space
- **Scene completion**: Predicting complete 3D scenes from partial observations
- **Multi-modal fusion**: Combining point cloud data with camera images for enhanced perception

## Applications

Our research enables next-generation autonomous systems, from self-driving vehicles to robotic manipulation, by providing robust 3D scene understanding capabilities.
