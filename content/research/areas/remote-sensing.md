Our remote sensing research applies advanced computer vision techniques to satellite and aerial imagery for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and agricultural applications.

## Research Focus

- **Hyperspectral image analysis**: Processing images with hundreds of spectral bands
- **Object detection**: Identifying objects of interest in satellite imagery
- **Change detection**: Monitoring environmental and urban changes over time
- **Land cover classification**: Automated mapping of land use from satellite data

## Applications

Our work supports environmental monitoring, disaster response, agricultural management, and urban planning through improved analysis of Earth observation data.
