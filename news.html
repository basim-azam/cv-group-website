          <h3>CVPR 2025 Paper Accepted</h3>
          <p>
            Our paper on plug-and-play interpretable responsible text-to-image generation has been accepted
            at CVPR 2025. This work presents a novel approach to controlling generative AI models through
            dual-space multi-facet concept control, enabling more responsible image generation.

          <h3>Two Papers Accepted at ECCV 2024</h3>
          <p>
            Our group has two papers accepted at ECCV 2024. The first paper investigates regulating model
            reliance on non-robust features, and the second explores adversarial robustness in vision
            transformers. Congratulations to all co-authors!
